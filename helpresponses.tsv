chip	Battle Chips are one-use attacks that NetOps slot into their PETs.\nYour PET's folder space is determined by your **Navi's Mind + Navi's Info + 2**.\nWhen making a new character, pick starter Battle Chips equal to your **NetOp's Mind + NetOp's Info + 2**.\n\nAfter a Navi uses a Battle Chip, they need to jack out to make that Battle Chip usable again, or to change your Battle Chip folder. **Folders often may not have duplicate Battle Chips, or more than 1 Mega Chip.**\n\nThis command can display info on Battle Chips.
ncp	NCPs (Or Navi Customizer Programs) are installable software NetOps can use to modify their Navi! They can give various perks like increasing folder size, granting access to special Navi powers, and more!\n**Check with your GM to see how many EB (Exabytes) your character starts with!**\n\nThis command can display NCPs.
power	All Navis have Navi Powers: special abilities they can use whenever they like.\nThere are two types: Cost and Roll powers.\n**    - Cost powers reduce the listed stat by 1 until jack out and __do not affect liberation mission alarm countdowns__.\n    - Roll powers roll the associated skill to use the power.**\n\nThis command can display navi and virus powers: Cost, Roll, and Passive powers.
virus	Viruses are programs with simple, animal-like intelligences that wreak havoc across the internet. With lots of different shapes and sizes, some are more dangerous than others. Viruses use powers just like navis, and some even have special passive abilities!\n**All viruses have data within them that can be downloaded with a blankchip upon deletion.**\n\nThis command can pull up a basic Virus description.
virusx	This specific command pulls up full stats for viruses, like stats and drops. __This command is more for GMs, than players in a session.__

parry	A character can try to counter a melee attack with a melee attack of their own, called a **__parry__**. Both parties roll using the appropriate skill, likely Strength. Whoever has the most hits wins, and the loser takes damage equal to the winner’s roll. This damage is not reduced by how many hits the loser rolled.\n\nIf the two characters tie, they have a choice: back out or escalate. Both parties should declare this simultaneously. If both back out, nobody takes damage and the parry ends. If one escalates and the other backs out, the parry ends and the one that backed out is the loser. If both parties escalate, roll to melee attack each other again. Whoever rolls higher is the winner, unless they tie; in which case, the cycle continues until someone comes out on top. \n\nUnless both back out, when the parry ends, the loser takes damage equal to the winner’s strongest attack. However, if the loser backed out, they take half the damage they normally would, rounded up.
query	The Query command is used to filter through **Chips**, **NCPs (by EB)**, **Navi Power Upgrade NCPs**, **License Chip Tiers**, and **Navi Powers**! There are a few things unique marked here.\n    **-** Chips marked with ***(__S__)*** are __Starter Chips.__ They are listed as the first chips in any query with them.\n    **-**  Chips marked ***(__PMC__)*** are __Player-Made Content.__ Certain sessions may not support or allow Player-Made Content as a permanent reward, like NetBattle Club. Please check with your GMs before adding/asking for these.\n   **-** NCPs are marked with ***(__NCP__)*** are __Crossover NCPs__. This is here to help alleviate confusion when querying crossover content.
talents	NetOps often get one Talent. Talents can be any area of expertise or interest. They should be general enough that they could organically come up (e.g. “Theater,” not “Ancient Opera”), but not so general that they apply more often than they don’t (e.g. “Judo,” not “Fighting”).\n**Once per session, a NetOp can turn a failure/partial success into a success if it falls under their Talent. __This only applies to NetOp rolls.__**
